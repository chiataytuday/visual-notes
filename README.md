# visual-notes
Source code the the IOS application VisualNotes. I removed the application and stopped development with the release of IOS 7 
as by then the majority of the functinality was avilable via the standard IOS applications and it was not worth
re-designing the application to match the new IOS 7 UI conventions.

Below is the original description of the Application when it was published to the AppStore

---
Visualual Notes makes it easy to create location aware notes using the camera, photo library, or keyboard. 
Notes are geo-tagged using the iPhone's built-in Location technology allowing you see when and where they were created. 
The intuitive and easy-to-use interface makes it easy to manage all of your photo and text notes in one place and remove 
the clutter from your photo library.

Features:

- Create notes using the camera, photo library and keyboard
- Easily add text to your visual notes, or create text only notes
- Full screen photo mode that supports 'pinch to zoom' and 'tap to zoom'
- Map view showing where the note was created
- Share your notes via email
- Retina Display support
- Supports iOS 4 fast app switching
